# Summary

In this work next day load is predicted based on historical data. 

Three different models are evaluated.

Baseline: Average of the load over the past 4 weeks.
TBATS Model: A time series forecasting model that incorporates multiple seasonalities and trend components.
SARIMAX with Fourier series: A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model enhanced with Fourier series for capturing seasonality.

The result shows the baseline approach achieved the lowest MAPE.
